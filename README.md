# AcademicReferenceManager

## Description
This is a an academic reference management application which allows the user to enter bibliographic information about journal articles, persist this information within their account, and generate properly formatted citations in a variety of citation styles.

I have developed this project to practice "bread and butter" fundamentals of web development: an Angular user interface implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality; REST APIs; object-relational mapping; and persistence to a relational database.
